========================================================================

This will be the public release of my Kinect 3D video capture software.

Unfortunately, it is based on the Vrui toolkit, version 2.0 -- which is
not (quite) released yet. It should be done in a couple of days, but as
of right now, the most recent public Vrui release is 1.0-068.

This software will unfortunately *not* completely build on top of
Vrui-1.0. I still decided to release the actual code right away; even if
there are some problems building it, others can already take a peek at
the underlying algorithms and start their own projects.

Once Vrui-2.0 is released, this code will build and run on top of it.
Promise!
