Kinect 3D Video Capture Project History
=======================================

Kinect-0.01:
- Initial release, needs Vrui-2.0 to build.

Kinect-1.0:
- Update with refactoring and additional vislet and raw viewer.
- First "official" release.

Kinect-1.1:
- Added color camera calibration procedure to RawKinectViewer.

Kinect-1.2:
- Added support to merge 3D images from multiple Kinect cameras in
  KinectViewer.
- Added serial numbers to camera calibration files.
- Added projector transformation files.
- Added calibration program to align multiple Kinect cameras.
- Added ability to save the 3D video stream from one or multiple Kinect
  cameras.
- Added (experimental) ability to play back previously recorded 3D video
  streams.

Kinect-1.3:
- Bumped Vrui version requirement to Vrui-2.1-001.
- Added compression for depth and color streams.
- Added streaming server and client viewer application for real-time 3D
  video transmission.
- Added new grid-based calibration method in RawKinectViewer.
- Added initial prototype of space carving algorithm to create
  watertight meshes from multiple colocated Kinect 3D video streams.
- Added client and server plug-ins for Vrui's collaboration
  infrastructure to stream real-time 3D video between collaborating
  sites.

Kinect-1.4:
- Bumped Vrui version requirement to Vrui-2.2-001.

Kinect-2.0:
- Bumped Vrui version requirement to Vrui-2.3-001.
- Major code reorganization.
- Build system changed to new modular Vrui build system.
- Added check if Vrui was built with libusb-1 support.

Kinect-2.1:
- Bumped Vrui version requirement to Vrui-2.4-001.
- Changed RawKinectViewer to properly check for non-power-of-two texture
  support, to make it work better on lame OpenGL installations.
- Changed depth viewer in RawKinectViewer to use a value-ramped rainbow
  color map.
- Added support for per-pixel depth correction to account for lens
  distortion in the depth camera.
- Improved modularity of Kinect package classes.
- Added ability to save reconstructed surfaces as mesh files.
- Changed collaboration plug-in to temporarily disable clipping while
  rendering remote 3D video.

Kinect-2.2:
- Created Kinect::Renderer class to handle common case of rendering 3D
  video from a 3D video stream source.
- Reimplemented Kinect collaboration plug-in using new Kinect::Renderer
  class.
- Moved collaboration plug-in classes into separate subdirectory and
  fixed makefile.

Kinect-2.3:
- Bumped Vrui version requirement to Vrui-2.5-001.
- Fixed behavior of Kinect::MultiplexedFrameSource in cluster
  environments.
- Fixed installation location of KinectServer.cfg. Pointed out by David
  Raila.
- Fixed cluster issues in Kinect client collaboration protocol plug-in.
- Added button to load background removal images to KinectViewer.
- Added detailed description of new intrinsic calibration procedure to
  README file.
- Made small changes to build system in line with Vrui.

Kinect-2.4:
- Bumped Vrui version requirement to Vrui-2.6-001.
- Added ability to record and play back synchronized audio in
  KinectViewer.

Kinect-2.5:
- Fixed installation path for make configuration file if INSTALLPREFIX
  is specified. Pointed out by Braden Pellett.
- Added initial support for lossy depth stream compression when writing
  3D video to files or sending over a network. The current compression
  method, using an unmodified Theora codec and bit-stuffing 11-bit raw
  depth values into an 8-bit YpCbCr 4:2:0 frame, does not work.
- Hopeful fix to get Kinect working on USB 3.0 bus.
- Replaced previous per-pixel depth correction method with method based
  on bivariate uniform non-rational B-splines.
  - Depth correction can now be used in remote collaboration systems,
    for improved alignment.
